- Predictions and Plotting

## Convolutional Neural Networks 
<p>A Convolutional Neural Netowork is a Deep Learning Alogorithm. CNN takes in a input image, Learnable weights and bias in an image and tries to distinguish betwween one another.</p> 
<p>The main criteria of CNN is produce a good prediction that results in better images after continuous learning without eliminating the features.</p>
